# Red Queen

_Give Queen Red Hair._

A mod for [Queen's Brothel](https://queensbrothel.com/)

## Improvements
Hair can be cleaned up a bit, this breaks clothing previews and character portraits, I need to reexport those images as well.

Some skins don't work well as they depended on Queen having black hair:
- Angel - Halo headband
- Orc - Black Undercut
- Garnet - One sliver missing from the left side of the hair

Luckily the devil skin works quite well with the headband.

## Actions
